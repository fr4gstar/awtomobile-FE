# "Awtomobile" 

## The idea: Budget and Usage-Based Automobile Search Engine
The idea behind this prototype is to show a different approach for users to look for a new car.
The online ad car market with providers like autoscout24.com or mobile.de has always the same approach.
You need to know which manufacturer, model etc. you want to search for.

But what if you only need a car to drive or for transportation, you´re not an automobile enthusiast and you´re not into trademarks? 
So the idea is basically to start to ask the user whats the budget is and how much he/she will drive and want to keep the car. The engine shows you a score on how well it fits with your search parameters.

Other options could be:
- Optional Parameters like car model, features etc.
- Exclude some models or manufacturers
- Choose type of Car
- Transportation volume etc.

Recommendation (Score) based on:
- Acquisition Costs
- Insurance Costs
- Tax Costs
- Repair Costs (Repair Indexes * Average Repair Costs)
- Use Costs (Gasoline prices * Usages)
- (residual value)
